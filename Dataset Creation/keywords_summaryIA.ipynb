    "These keywords are filtered to remove duplicates and non-informative phrases (e.g., \"reviewers say\"), then ranked by relevance scores.

This integration enriches the dataset with audience-perspective descriptors, improving its coverage and relevance.\n",

    "4. **Ranking and Voting:** Remaining new keywords are sorted in descending order by relevance score. Helpful vote counts are assigned incrementally starting just above the maximum existing vote count for the film, ensuring that the most relevant keywords receive the highest votes.\n",

    "5. **Dataframe Construction:** A new dataframe is created for the filtered keywords, including their associated `Movie_ID`, keyword text, and assigned helpful and not helpful vote counts.\n",
