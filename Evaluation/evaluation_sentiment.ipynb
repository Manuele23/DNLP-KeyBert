    "This notebook evaluates and compares different keyword extraction models applied to movie reviews, with a specific focus on assessing how well each model captures not only semantic relevance but also **sentiment alignment** with the content of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to assess the performance of two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base** KeyBERT model\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment-aware** version that integrates a custom sentiment classifier to enrich the keyword scoring process (KeyBERTSentimentAware)\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation is performed on a set of reviews for each movie, where both models predict a ranked list of top-5 keywords per review. Each keyword is associated with a confidence score; in the sentiment-aware model, this score incorporates both relevance and predicted sentiment intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **ground truth dataset** of annotated keywords per movie retrieved from IMDB\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model outputs**: top-5 predicted keywords per review, each with a relevance (and possibly sentiment-based) score\n",
    "\n",
    "Four complementary evaluation layers are used to provide a comprehensive comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Basic (Unweighted) Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** based on approximate binary matching\n",
    "\n",
    "- A keyword is considered correct if it approximately matches any of the ground truth keywords for the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each review is evaluated independently and the scores are averaged\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Score-Aware Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted Precision/Recall/F1**: correct predictions are weighted based on the model’s score (semantic or sentiment-aware)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **nDCG@5**: evaluates how well the top-ranked predictions align with the expected set of keywords, rewarding correct keywords appearing earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Semantic Evaluation (Embedding-Based)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses **sentence-transformer embeddings** and **cosine similarity** to detect approximate semantic matches between predicted and ground truth keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "- A predicted keyword is considered correct if it reaches a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.75) with any ground truth keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic Precision, Recall, and F1-score are then computed based on these soft matches\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Sentiment Appropriateness Score (SAS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluates how well the **average sentiment of the predicted keywords** aligns with the **sentiment of the review**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two variants are computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `SAS_from_keywords`: compares the sentiment of predicted keywords to the average sentiment of the ground truth keywords (estimated using VADER)\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `SAS_from_text`: compares the sentiment of predicted keywords to the sentiment of the full preprocessed review text\n",
    "\n",
    "- SAS values closer to 1 indicate better emotional alignment between the predictions and the reference\n",
    "\n",
    "The sentiment-aware model is designed not just to select relevant keywords, but also to reflect the emotional tone of the review in its predictions. While the base KeyBERT model selects keywords based solely on semantic similarity, the sentiment-aware version explicitly integrates sentiment prediction into the keyword ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing **SAS**, we quantify this difference and validate whether the added sentiment signal results in predictions that are not only relevant but also emotionally coherent with the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentiment-aware evaluation helps bridge the gap between **semantic correctness** and **emotional alignment**, offering a more holistic understanding of keyword quality in user-generated content.\n"

    "In this section, we evaluate and compare the **Base** and **Sentiment-enhanced** keyword extraction models using a **semantic similarity approach** based on contextual embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional evaluation metrics typically check for exact or approximate string matches between predicted and ground truth keywords. However, this can miss semantically related terms that are lexically different but convey the same meaning — for example, *\"scam\"* and *\"fraud\"*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this limitation, we leverage **sentence embeddings** generated by a pre-trained transformer model (such as a sentence-transformer). Each keyword — both predicted and ground truth — is converted into a dense vector representation that captures its semantic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the semantic evaluation works in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Embedding keywords**:  \n",
    "    Both predicted keywords and ground truth keywords are embedded into high-dimensional vectors using the same model. The ground truth keywords are embedded **once beforehand** to avoid redundant computations. These embeddings are normalized to ensure cosine similarity is a valid similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Computing similarity scores**:  \n",
    "   We calculate the **cosine similarity** between every predicted keyword embedding and every ground truth keyword embedding, resulting in a similarity matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Determining matches using a threshold**:  \n",
    "   A predicted keyword is considered a **semantic match** if its cosine similarity with at least one ground truth keyword exceeds a set threshold (e.g., 0.75). This threshold balances between strictness and flexibility in matching semantic content.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Calculating semantic precision**:  \n",
    "   This is the fraction of predicted keywords that have a semantic match in the ground truth. It reflects how many of the model’s predictions are meaningful and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Calculating semantic recall**:  \n",
    "   This is the fraction of ground truth keywords that are captured by semantically similar predicted keywords. It indicates how well the model covers the essential concepts of the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Calculating semantic F1-score**:  \n",
    "   The harmonic mean of semantic precision and recall, providing a single measure that balances both aspects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By evaluating keyword extraction in this semantic space, the metric is more robust to lexical variation and better reflects the true relevance of the predictions. This provides a deeper understanding of how well each model captures the **meaning** behind the ground truth keywords, beyond surface-level text matches."

    "To further evaluate the quality of the predicted keywords from a sentiment-aware perspective, we introduce the **Sentiment Appropriateness Score (SAS)**. This metric measures how well the **overall sentiment of the predicted keywords aligns with the sentiment of the ground truth** or the original review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score focus on **syntactic correctness**, but they do not assess whether the predicted keywords **reflect the emotional tone** of the review. SAS addresses this by incorporating sentiment into the evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute SAS in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SAS from Ground Truth Keywords**  \n",
    "   The sentiment of the review is approximated using the set of ground truth keywords. Each keyword is analyzed using **VADER**, and its sentiment is mapped using the following weights:  \n",
    "   - `pos` → 1.0  \n",
    "   - `neu` → 0.5  \n",
    "   - `neg` → 0.0  \n",
    "   The final sentiment is the average of these values. This reference sentiment is compared to the average sentiment of the predicted keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SAS from Review Text**  \n",
    "   If the full review text is available, we compute its sentiment using the same weighted VADER scheme and compare it to the sentiment of the predicted keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, SAS is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{SAS} = 1 - |\\text{sentiment}_{\\text{predicted}} - \\text{sentiment}_{\\text{reference}}|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Values closer to **1** indicate that the predicted keywords are **emotionally aligned** with the ground truth or the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is optimized for **short, informal text** like keywords or tags.  \n",
    "- It works well for **single words and short phrases**, which are the output of our models.  \n",
    "- It provides class-level probabilities (`pos`, `neu`, `neg`) that are directly usable for **interpretable sentiment scoring**.  \n",
    "- It is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for **large-scale evaluation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "While transformer-based sentiment models may be more powerful for longer text, **VADER offers the best trade-off** between accuracy, interpretability, and scalability for our keyword-level sentiment matching task."
