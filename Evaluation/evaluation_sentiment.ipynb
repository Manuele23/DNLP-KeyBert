    "This notebook evaluates and compares different keyword extraction models applied to movie reviews, with a specific focus on assessing how well each model captures not only **semantic relevance** but also **sentiment alignment** with the content of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assess the performance of two models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Base** KeyBERT model  \n",
    "- **Sentiment-aware** extension (KeyBERTSentimentAware), which integrates a custom sentiment classifier to adjust keyword relevance scores based on predicted sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook adopts a **global evaluation approach**: all predicted and ground truth keywords across the entire dataset are aggregated **before** computing each metric. This provides a **holistic view** of each model's performance, unaffected by review-level variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a set of annotated ground truth keywords per movie (from IMDb), and the top-5 predicted keywords (with scores) per review for both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Evaluation Layers**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Basic (Unweighted) Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** computed globally via approximate binary matching.\n",
    "- A predicted keyword is correct if it approximately matches any of the movie’s ground truth keywords.\n",
    "- All keywords from all reviews are flattened and compared in aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Score-Aware Metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**:\n",
    "  - Each predicted keyword is weighted by its score.\n",
    "  - Correct predictions contribute proportionally to their confidence.\n",
    "- **nDCG@5 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**:\n",
    "  - Evaluates whether correct keywords are ranked near the top globally.\n",
    "  - Relevance is discounted by position, rewarding better keyword orderings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Semantic Evaluation (Embedding-Based)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All predicted and ground truth keywords are embedded using a **sentence-transformer** model.\n",
    "- **Cosine similarity** is used to detect approximate **semantic matches**.\n",
    "- A predicted keyword is correct if its similarity with any ground truth keyword exceeds a given threshold (e.g., **0.75**).\n",
    "- **Semantic Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score** are computed globally based on these soft matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Sentiment Appropriateness Score (SAS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This novel metric evaluates **how well the sentiment of predicted keywords aligns with the sentiment of the review**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two global variants are computed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SAS_from_keywords**:  \n",
    "  - Computes the average sentiment of predicted keywords (via VADER or custom classifier).  \n",
    "  - Compares it to the average sentiment of the ground truth keywords for the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SAS_from_text**:  \n",
    "  - Compares the average sentiment of the predicted keywords to the sentiment of the **full review text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "SAS values are normalized in [0, 1], where values closer to 1 indicate higher emotional coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why Sentiment-Aware Evaluation Matters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **base** KeyBERT model selects keywords based only on semantic relevance, while the **sentiment-aware** version ranks keywords based on a combination of **semantic and emotional cues**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional evaluations may overlook whether the extracted keywords convey the **emotional tone** of the review.  \n",
    "By introducing **Sentiment Appropriateness Scores**, we quantify this alignment explicitly and verify whether integrating sentiment enhances both **relevance** and **emotional fidelity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This global, multi-dimensional evaluation provides a robust framework for comparing keyword extraction systems beyond surface-level matching.\n"

    "To further evaluate the quality of predicted keywords from a sentiment-aware perspective, we introduce the **Sentiment Appropriateness Score (SAS)**. This metric assesses how well the **overall sentiment of the predicted keywords** aligns with the **sentiment of the ground truth keywords** or the **sentiment of the full review text**, providing a complementary dimension to traditional keyword evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard metrics like **Precision**, **Recall**, or **F1**, which measure lexical or semantic correctness, SAS explicitly measures **emotional alignment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Two Global Evaluation Schemes**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SAS from Ground Truth Keywords**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The sentiment of the reference is approximated using all ground truth keywords for the movie.\n",
    "   - Each ground truth keyword is analyzed using **VADER** sentiment analyzer.\n",
    "   - The sentiment score is calculated as a weighted combination:\n",
    "     - `pos` → 1.0\n",
    "     - `neu` → 0.5\n",
    "     - `neg` → 0.0\n",
    "   - The average sentiment across all ground truth keywords forms the **reference sentiment**.\n",
    "   - This is compared to the **global average sentiment** of all predicted keywords (across reviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SAS from Review Text**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The sentiment of the review set is approximated by aggregating the sentiments of the full review texts.\n",
    "   - Each review is processed with VADER using the same weighted scoring.\n",
    "   - The resulting average sentiment is compared to the sentiment of all predicted keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{SAS} = 1 - \\left| \\text{Sentiment}_{\\text{predicted}} - \\text{Sentiment}_{\\text{reference}} \\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "SAS is a value in **\\[0, 1\\]**, where values closer to **1** indicate stronger emotional coherence between the predicted keywords and the reference source (either ground truth keywords or full review text).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why VADER?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose **VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)** for its suitability in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is optimized for **short, informal text** like tags and keywords.\n",
    "- It works well on **single words and short phrases**, which represent our prediction outputs.\n",
    "- It provides interpretable and **probabilistic sentiment scores** (`pos`, `neu`, `neg`).\n",
    "- It is lightweight, efficient, and scalable for large-scale global evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although transformer-based sentiment models may offer more nuanced analysis on long text, VADER provides the best **balance of performance, interpretability, and scalability** for evaluating the emotional tone of predicted keywords in our keyword extraction task.\n"
