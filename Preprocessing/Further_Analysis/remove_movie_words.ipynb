    "\n",
    "This cell uses **spaCy's semantic similarity** between word vectors to identify words that are conceptually related to the **cinema domain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method:\n",
    "1. Load the `en_core_web_md` model, which includes **pre-trained word embeddings**.\n",
    "2. Each word is mapped to a **semantic vector** that captures its meaning based on distributional context.\n",
    "3. The semantic vector of the reference word **\"movie\"** is extracted.\n",
    "4. For each word in the list of most frequent terms, the **cosine similarity** with the vector for \"movie\" is computed.\n",
    "5. If the similarity is above a threshold (here: **0.3**), the word is considered semantically related to \"movie\", and thus potentially **cinema-related**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation:\n",
    "Words like **\"good\"** or **\"great\"** often co-occur with movie-related terms in text corpora. Therefore, even if they express **general sentiment** rather than being **specific to cinema**, spaCy may assign them high similarity scores to **\"movie\"**. This can lead to **false positives** in domain filtering.\n"

    "\n",
    "This cell combines **semantic similarity analysis with sentiment filtering** to extract words that are conceptually related to cinema, while excluding emotionally charged terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach:\n",
    "- **spaCy's `en_core_web_md`** is used to compute semantic similarity between each word and the reference word **\"movie\"**.\n",
    "- Words with a **cosine similarity > 0.3** are considered semantically related to the cinema domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentiment Filtering:\n",
    "To avoid including general opinion words like \"good\" or \"great\", we use **VADER** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), a sentiment analysis tool from **NLTK**:\n",
    "- For each word, VADER returns a **compound sentiment score**.\n",
    "- If the **absolute value** of the compound score is **greater than 0.3**, the word is considered sentiment-laden and is excluded from the cinema-related list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Output:\n",
    "The result is a DataFrame containing **frequent, cinema-related words** that are **not emotionally biased**, useful for building cleaner domain-specific keyword lists or filters.\n"
