The script is overwhelmed by the petty political aspects of the story at the expense of the real story, the actual making of the bomb. . The intrusive soundtrack during the security clearance hearing was painful to listen to.This could have been a much smaller and better film about the politics of the security clearance hearing, but no, we have to cram in every major actor you can dredge up so the audience will know how important this film is, make the serial aspect overly long.(by an hour.at least). And make the most interesting part of the story, the actual building of the bomb feel like a mere anecdote .Like the recent film Maestro, we once again have proof that Hollywood is incapable of telling a narrative story. Also like Maestro the scenes are completely predictable, with no payoff at the end of the film. Given the massive bloat in this carcinogenic tumor, you could not manage to find time to actually finish the story with the end of his life and death?While Murphey's performance is adequate, do we really need 500 closeups of his anguish? Do you think we are that stupid that we require that? Chris, sometimes less is more.</td>\n",

It's a bit of a marathon to watch and begins to run out of steam in the last part.Therefore for the first 2 hrs 8/10 but overall 7.5/10Would I watch this again ? No, for me it's a watch once (and well worth a watch) but i'm unlikely to do so again.   \n",
       "1263  Christopher Nolan once again proves to be the master of the incoherent bloated blockbuster. The script is overwhelmed by the petty political aspects of the story at the expense of the real story, the actual making of the bomb. . The intrusive soundtrack during the security clearance hearing was painful to listen to.This could have been a much smaller and better film about the politics of the security clearance hearing, but no, we have to cram in every major actor you can dredge up so the audience will know how important this film is, make the serial aspect overly long.(by an hour.at least). And make the most interesting part of the story, the actual building of the bomb feel like a mere anecdote .Like the recent film Maestro, we once again have proof that Hollywood is incapable of telling a narrative story. Also like Maestro the scenes are completely predictable, with no payoff at the end of the film. Given the massive bloat in this carcinogenic tumor, you could not manage to find time to actually finish the story with the end of his life and death?While Murphey's performance is adequate, do we really need 500 closeups of his anguish? Do you think we are that stupid that we require that? Chris, sometimes less is more.   \n",
