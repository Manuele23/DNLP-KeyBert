    "This notebook introduces a **sentiment-aware extension** of the KeyBERT keyword extraction model, which integrates sentiment information directly into the candidate selection and ranking process. Unlike simple post-hoc reranking approaches, this method incorporates sentiment consistency during both candidate filtering and final keyword scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional KeyBERT extracts candidate keywords purely based on semantic similarity between the document embedding and candidate embeddings. This extension enhances the process by considering the **emotional coherence** between candidates and the document, operationalized as continuous sentiment polarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "-  $\\text{sim}_{sem}$ : cosine similarity between document and candidate embeddings,\n",
    "-  $s_{doc} \\in [0,1]$: continuous sentiment polarity score of the document,\n",
    "-  $s_{cand} \\in [0,1]$: continuous sentiment polarity score of a candidate keyword,\n",
    "\n",
    "we define the **sentiment alignment score** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{align}(s_{doc}, s_{cand}) = 1 - |s_{doc} - s_{cand}|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which equals 1 for perfect polarity match and decreases linearly to 0 for maximal polarity difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall combined score used to filter and rank candidates is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{score}_{final} = w_{sentiment} \\times \\text{align}(s_{doc}, s_{cand}) + (1 - w_{sentiment}) \\times \\text{sim}_{sem}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $$ w_{sentiment} \\in [0,1] $$ is a tunable weight balancing sentiment alignment and semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated sentiment filtering**: Sentiment is incorporated early to filter out candidates that are sentimentally incongruent with the document, not only at reranking stage.\n",
    "- **Continuous sentiment modeling**: Uses probability-weighted sentiment polarity scores from a pretrained transformer classifier, enabling nuanced sentiment comparisons.\n",
    "- **Flexible weighting parameter**: The parameter \\( w_{sentiment} \\) allows task-specific tuning of the relative importance of sentiment versus semantic relevance.\n",
    "- **Candidate generation enhancement**: The candidate pool is initially large and filtered by combined semantic and sentiment scores, improving quality and relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages Over Post-hoc Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike reranking approaches that adjust keyword order **after** candidate generation, this method filters candidates **before** ranking, reducing noise and irrelevant candidates early.\n",
    "- Sentiment influences the candidate pool itself, resulting in more coherent and contextually appropriate keyword extraction.\n",
    "- The approach remains compatible with any KeyBERT-compatible embedding model and sentiment classification backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intended Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "This sentiment-aware KeyBERT extension is especially suited for sentiment-rich domains such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product and service reviews\n",
    "- Social media opinion mining\n",
    "- Customer feedback analysis\n",
    "- Any text where emotional tone is critical to understanding key themes\n",
    "\n",
    "It enables the extraction of keywords that are both topically relevant and emotionally aligned, enhancing interpretability and downstream analysis.\n"

    "## SentimentModel Class: Transformer-based Sentiment Probability Predictor\n",
    "\n",
    "The `SentimentModel` class is a wrapper around a pretrained HuggingFace transformer model designed for sentiment classification. It provides a convenient interface to obtain **probability distributions over sentiment classes** for batches of input texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose and Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model loading:**  \n",
    "  Upon initialization, the class loads both the tokenizer and the sequence classification model specified by the `model_name`.  \n",
    "  By default, it uses `\"nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment\"`, a multilingual BERT model fine-tuned for 5-class sentiment classification (1 to 5 stars).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Device management:**  \n",
    "  The model and tokenizer are moved to the specified device (`cpu` or `cuda`).  \n",
    "  Input validation ensures that `cuda` is only used if a compatible GPU is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch sentiment prediction:**  \n",
    "  The core method `predict_proba` takes a list of texts and:  \n",
    "  1. Tokenizes and encodes them into the format expected by the transformer.  \n",
    "  2. Performs a forward pass through the model without computing gradients (efficient inference).  \n",
    "  3. Applies a softmax to the output logits to obtain a probability distribution over the sentiment classes for each text.  \n",
    "  4. Returns a NumPy array of shape `(batch_size, num_classes)` containing the class probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Allows seamless integration of sentiment analysis into larger NLP pipelines.\n",
    "- Outputs probabilistic sentiment scores, enabling nuanced, continuous sentiment representations rather than hard labels.\n",

    "## KeyBERTSentimentAware Class: Sentiment-Integrated Keyword Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "This class extends the base KeyBERT model by integrating sentiment analysis directly into the keyword extraction pipeline. It enhances the traditional semantic-only approach by incorporating continuous sentiment polarity scores for both the entire document and each candidate keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Candidate Extraction:**  \n",
    "  Uses `CountVectorizer` to extract a broad pool of candidate keywords (n-grams) from the document text.  \n",
    "  **Note:** This initial candidate generation is purely statistical and **does not incorporate sentiment information**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis:**  \n",
    "  Leverages a pretrained transformer sentiment classification model to compute **continuous sentiment polarity scores** ranging from 0 (very negative) to 1 (very positive) for both the document and each candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Combined Scoring and Filtering:**  \n",
    "  Calculates a weighted score combining:\n",
    "  - Semantic similarity (cosine similarity between embeddings).\n",
    "  - Sentiment alignment (1 minus the absolute difference between candidate and document sentiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "  Candidates with combined scores below a threshold are **filtered out before final ranking**, effectively integrating sentiment as a filter immediately after candidate extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The weighting is controlled by `weight_sentiment`:\n",
    "  - `weight_sentiment=1.0` means keywords are ranked purely by sentiment alignment.\n",
    "  - `weight_sentiment=0.0` means keywords are ranked purely by semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Candidate Selection in KeyBERT vs Sentiment-Aware Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original KeyBERT model, the candidate keywords are extracted purely based on **statistical properties** of the text. Specifically, KeyBERT uses a tool like `CountVectorizer` to identify n-grams (contiguous sequences of words) that appear frequently or are relevant according to basic frequency statistics. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **candidate pool is generated without any semantic or sentiment understanding**.\n",
    "- All candidates are treated equally in this phase, regardless of their emotional tone or contextual relevance beyond raw occurrence patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This purely **statistical candidate extraction** can lead to a large number of candidates that are relevant but may not align emotionally with the overall document sentiment. For example, in a strongly negative review, KeyBERT might still generate positive-sounding candidates simply because those phrases appear often, potentially misrepresenting the sentiment conveyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, our sentiment-aware extension introduces a **joint filtering mechanism** that combines both semantic relevance and sentiment alignment **immediately after the initial statistical candidate extraction**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We first extract a large pool of candidates statistically using `CountVectorizer` to ensure broad coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We compute **continuous sentiment polarity scores** for both the entire document and each candidate keyword using a pretrained transformer sentiment model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We calculate a **combined score** for each candidate that balances:\n",
    "   - Semantic similarity to the document (embedding cosine similarity).\n",
    "   - Sentiment alignment with the document's overall polarity (inverted absolute difference between sentiment scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Candidates whose combined score falls below a threshold are **filtered out early**, significantly reducing the pool to those that are both topically and emotionally relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows the model to **avoid candidates that are semantically plausible but sentimentally inconsistent**, leading to more meaningful and context-aware keyword extraction.\n",
    "\n",
